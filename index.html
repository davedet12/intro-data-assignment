        <p> The MTA’s efforts to get transit rider’s to switch from MetroCards to OMNY cards appears to be working. </p>

        <p> At Flushing-Main St., one of the busiest stations in the transit system, OMNY usage has increased around fifty-five percent from the same time last year, according to a query of data collected on fare payment methods for the last full week of October of 2024 — the most recent full dataset available — against the last full week of October 2023. Conversely, the usage of MetroCards has decreased by thirty percent. </p>

        <p> According to Jake Berman, an independent researcher of public transportation, the adoption of OMNY can have positive effects on riders’ experience traveling within the city. </p>

        <p> “One of the ways that OMNY could be used to improve public transportation is by the MTA deciding that it doesn't matter which transit mode you use, as long as it's within the five boroughs,” says Berman. </p>

        <p> He argues that this would be particularly beneficial at stations that run parallel to LIRR lines, such as Flushing-Main St., and would help alleviate the strain on subway trains for taking the brunt of commuters into the city. </p>

        <p> “It's much cheaper than doing heavy construction,” Berman says. “I don't know why they haven't done it, but it's something that would make people's lives easier.” </p>
